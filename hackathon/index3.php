                      An India player is among at least ten members of the Chennai Super Kings contingent who have tested positive for Covid-19 in Dubai. ESPNcricinfo understands there is only one player among those who tested positive, with the rest of them comprising support staff members and a few net bowlers. One of those found positive is the wife of a senior Super Kings official, though the official himself has tested negative.

The infected persons are understood to have been moved to a different hotel from the team hotel, and are being monitored by medical personnel behind closed doors.

As a result of this development, Super Kings have been forced to postpone the start of their training in Dubai to September 1. According to the IPL's Standing Operating Procedures (SOPs), all those who tested positive will now need to undergo at least two weeks of further quarantine and clear two more tests before they can rejoin the group.

ESPNcricinfo understands the positive test results are from the final round of testing in the UAE, which is part of IPL's Covid-19 protocols comprising three tests that are mandatory for every person who is part of the tournament. As per the protocol, every person would get tested at the airport upon landing in the UAE, followed by two tests at the hotel on days 3 and 6. The protocol also makes it mandatory for everyone to undergo a six-day quarantine after landing, when they are not supposed to even mingle with team members or colleagues. Only once the squad members clear all the mandatory tests can teams start their training.

As per the original schedule, Super Kings would have started their training on Friday. However, their preparations are now in disarray. So far neither the franchise nor the IPL has made any public comment.

The IPL is to start on September 19, but the schedule is yet to be finalised. The development is bound to put the IPL on alert simply because Super Kings, who finished runners-up in 2019, are expected to play defending champions Mumbai Indians in the tournament opener.

Super Kings landed in Dubai on August 21 after part of their Indian contingent underwent a six-day conditioning camp in Chennai. That group included most of the senior Indian players in the squad including captain MS Dhoni, Suresh Raina, Ambati Rayudu, Deepak Chahar and Piyush Chawla.

What happens now?

According to tournament's SOPs, those who test positive have to be "immediately isolated from rest of the squad", and it is understood this has been done with the infected persons having been moved out of the team hotel. The SOPs also say "contact tracing" should "commence immediately".

If the person is "asymptomatic or has mild symptoms", then he/she would need to be isolated outside the biosecure bubble for two weeks from the "first day of symptoms or a positive PCR test report whichever is later".

The individual cannot also train during the 14-day isolation period and is advised complete rest. If the symptoms worsen then he/she would be shifted to a tournament-accredited hospital.

"After the 2 weeks isolation, the individual must return 2 negative PCR test reports done 24 hours apart before being permitted to re-enter the BioSecure Environment. After recovery, players must undergo a cardiac screening before resuming any team activities," is what the IPL said while distributing the SOPs to franchise recently.

                     Tom Banton's maiden T20I half-century was the highlight of another soggy evening at Emirates Old Trafford, but the weather had the defining word as the opening match of the series against Pakistan was abandoned due to rain.

Banton, seizing his chance to impress as opening batsman in the absence of Jos Buttler and Jason Roy, made an increasingly fluent 71. But rain, surely the most consistent performer of what is laughingly passing for summer in England, intervened about 80 minutes into the match and, while it relented around 40 minutes before the final restart time, the umpires concluded conditions were unfit for a resumption.

Pakistan will surely feel the more aggrieved of the sides. After weathering Banton's storm, they had reduced England to 131 for 6 in the 17th over and would have been the more confident of the teams having made decent use of winning an important toss.

It would have been even better, however, had Iftikhar Ahmed been able to cling on to a relatively simple chance offered by Banton on 5. The batsman had fiddled at one angled across him from Shaheen Shah Afridi but Iftikhar, at slip, put down the chance.

It looked, for a while, as if it would be a costly miss. For if Banton took a little while to adjust to a surface which had been under cover for much of the day due to rain - his first 20 runs occupied 19 deliveries - he soon found his stride. At one point, the 21-year-old thrashed 38 from 13 balls, demonstrating a powerful slog-sweep off the spinners and an audacious ability to scoop the seamers.

Shadab Khan bore the brunt of his assault. After conceding a slog-swept six to his first delivery, Khan bowled ever wider of off stump only to see Banton responding with ever more ferocious slog-sweeps. At one stage, he thrashed two successive sixes over midwicket and England plundered 58 in four overs.

But Banton's dismissal, top-edging another attempted heave across the line off the persevering Khan, precipitated a collapse from England. Four wickets fell for the addition of 14 runs in 19 deliveries as England lost their way against Pakistan's spinners.

Earlier Jonny Bairstow had fallen in the first over of the match, victim of a sharp return catch from Imad Wasim, before Dawid Malan ended up at the same end as Banton having set off for a sharp single in which his partner had no interest. In making just 34-1 from the first six overs, England registered their least productive powerplay since the World T20 final of 2016.

Eoin Morgan reverse-swept his first ball for four and thrashed his third for six but, when he missed a sweep, Moeen Ali edged an attempted cut and Lewis Gregory was stumped as he charged Imad, it meant England had lost four wickets in as many overs only two men had been able to reach 15.

Mohammad Rizwan impressed again in clinging on to the chance which dismissed Moeen, while the three spinners utilised by Pakistan combined to claim five wickets for the cost of 71 runs in nine overs.

Pakistan had sprung something of a surprise by not being able to find a place for Haider Ali in their side. Instead they included five spinning allrounders, including the veterans Mohammad Hafeez and Shoaib Malik, who made their debut in this format together in Pakistan's first T20I 14 years ago to the day against the same opposition.
